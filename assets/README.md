# Assets Directory

This directory contains app assets like images, icons, and splash screens.

## Required Assets

Before building the app, you'll need to add the following files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1284x2778px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

You can use any image editing tool or online services like:
- https://www.appicon.co/
- https://hotpot.ai/icon-resizer

For now, the app will work with placeholder defaults provided by Expo.
